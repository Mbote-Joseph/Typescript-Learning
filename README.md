```

### Type Safety

- It is about Type Safety.
- This ensures that mismatching errors are caught
- If one is consistent with the type of the variable it is very easy to catch the error.

### What Typescript does :

- Static Checking
- Like trying to access an object which is not defined.
- Trying to add a number of a variable that is not a number.
- Analyze the code as we type. That's it.

### What Typescript is not :

-

# Writing Typescript

- File has the extension of .ts
- TS is always transpiled into JavaScript
- Typescript is a development tool, Your project will be converted into JavaScript in production.
